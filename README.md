# Jarvis-Virtual-Assistant

Jarvis is a smart, voice-enabled virtual assistant developed using Python. It leverages multiple powerful libraries and APIs to carry out tasks through simple voice commands. Inspired by Tony Stark's iconic assistant, this project aims to bring a slice of that intelligence to your desktop.
Jarvis is capable of fetching real-time news updates, answering questions using OpenAI’s GPT models, opening websites, telling the time and date, and responding to your queries with speech output. It's designed as a modular, extensible platform to help anyone build a personalized digital assistant.

📌 Key Highlight

🧠 Natural Language Intelligence:
